        My Capstone is an E-Commerce website front end. I used React to build
        it. I was able to practice React specific development using hooks and
        React Router DOM. I also practiced more with Sass. I had a lot of fun,
        and learned a lot with this project. I wasn't as intimidated by this
        capstone as I was with the Fundementals capstone, but I was still very
        anxious to get it finished. I'm pretty happy with how much I've been
        able to strengthen my understanding of JS and React this semester.

        I've learned that development is really a perfect balance between using
        both sides of the brain. It is rational and analytical as well as
        creative. This is what makes development so satifying, solving problems
        as well as creating something new. I am still learning to break large
        projects down into smaller tasks and taking it step by step. I'm always
        surprised at how much I can accomplish if I set my anxiety aside and
        just start with something I know how to do.

        My favorite language really depends on the day. Some days I feel like
        being analytical and solving functional problems. Some days I like to
        focus on the creative styling of the page. I've really enjoyed learning
        React becasue it combines the functioanlity and style easier and quicker
        than the traditional HTML, JS, CSS framework. But I also like trying to
        figure things out in vanilla JS and playing with how powerful CSS can be
        on it's own, without the help of JS. I'm excited to learn more about the
        backend next semester. I think I'll enjoy learning more about APIs and
        how everthing is connected. I think I'll enjoy being able to switch
        between working on the front or backend as projects require.

Capstone Soft Deadline: Wed 12/14

Build an E-commerce App

Using the create-react-app toolchain and SCSS, create an online storefront.
Your products will come from the fake store api, linked below.
Your store must include:

- Home Page- add filter to the cards
- Products Page
  - filters for the categories
- Product Page (Show Route)
  - Count- ask Ryan Monday
- Cart Page
  - You should be able to add products to your cart (if there is quantity available).
  - Show the total
  - Checkout button (does not have to work)
  - remove from cart- DOn't use ID, removes all of that item even if there's 2. Quantity?
- Contact Page
  - Nicely styled contact form elements
  - This does not have to be functional, but wire up a notification that shows the user that the message was sent,
    and it should clear the form after.
- About Page
  - Explain your capstone
  - Explain what you learned throughout your time here
  - Explain your favorite languages and why
- Responsive designs (just mobile and desktop is fine)

Keep UX in mind. Reference other sites and designs, and make this your own!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

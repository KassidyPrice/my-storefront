Capstone Soft Deadline: Wed 12/14

<!-- - Home Page- add filter to the cards, Ask Ryan -->
  <!-- - filters for the categories - filter multiple catagories -->

- Count- ask Ryan Monday
- You should be able to add products to your cart (if there is quantity available).
<!-- - remove from cart- Don't use ID, removes all of that item even if there's 2. Quantity? -->
- Contact Page
  - Nicely styled contact form elements
  - This does not have to be functional, but wire up a notification that shows the user that the message was sent,
    and it should clear the form after.
- Responsive designs (just mobile and desktop is fine)

Keep UX in mind. Reference other sites and designs, and make this your own!
